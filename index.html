       <H2> An Argument for Cats</H2>
       <p>Cats can love their owners more than dogs 

        Cats always want to be pet by their owners
        
        Moreover, cats do not ask their owners to take them for walks. They go for walks by themselves and come back home again.

        <h2> An Argument for Dogs </h2>
        <p> Although cats may love their owner, they dont quite share the loyalty a dog has for their owners. Dog a wellknown as "Man's Bestfriend". Last I checked, cats are not known for anything to man.</p>
