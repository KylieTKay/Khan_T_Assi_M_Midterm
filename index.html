      <p>  Cats are my favourite animal,

        I like cats because they are funny and independent,
        
        Cats are cute and clean unlike dogs.

                      <p>  Cats can love their owners more than dogs, 

                        Cats always want to be pet by their owners,
                        
                        Moreover, cats do not ask their owners to take them for walks. They go for walks by themselves and come back home again. 
                        </p>
